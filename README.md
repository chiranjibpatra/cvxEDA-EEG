It is based on a model which describes EDA as the sum of three terms: the
phasic component, the tonic component, and an additive white Gaussian noise
term incorporating model prediction errors as well as measurement errors and
artifacts.
This model is physiologically inspired and fully explains EDA through a
rigorous methodology based on Bayesian statistics, mathematical convex
optimization and sparsity.

The algorithm was evaluated in three different experimental sessions
(see paper) to test its robustness to noise, its ability to separate and
identify stimulus inputs, and its capability of properly describing the
activity of the autonomic nervous system in response to strong affective
stimulation.
